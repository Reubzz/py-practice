## UNIT 1:

### Explain the features of python.
- Easy-to-learn: Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
- Python Supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP
- Easy-to-maintain: Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain
- A broad standard library: Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh. 
- Interactive Mode: Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code. . 
- Databases: Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
- Python can be dynamically typed which means we don’t need to declare data types in variables in advance like we do in C programming

### Explain debugging and error types in Python.

Programming is error-prone. For whimsical reasons, programming errors are called bugs and the process of tracking them down is called debugging.
Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: Syntax errors, Runtime errors, and Semantic errors.
- Syntax errors:
    - Python can only execute a program if the syntax is correct; otherwise, the interpreter displays an error message.
    - Syntax refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure.
    - For example, parentheses have to come in matching pairs, so (1 + 2) is legal, but 8) is a syntax error.

- Runtime errors:
    - A program with a runtime error is one that passed the interpreter’s syntax checks, and started to execute
    - However, during the execution of one of the statements in the program, an error occurred that caused the interpreter to stop executing the program and display an error message
    - Runtime errors are also called **exceptions** because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.
    - Here are some examples of common runtime errorsr:
    - Misspelled or incorrectly capitalized variable and function names
    - Attempts to perform operations (such as math operations) on data of the wrong type (ex. attempting to subtract two variables that hold string values)

- Semantic errors:
    - The third type of error is the semantic error.
    - If there is a semantic error in your program, it will run successfully in the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages, but it will not do the right thing.
    - It will do something else. The problem is that the program you wrote is not the program you wanted to write.
    - The meaning of the program (its semantics) is wrong.
    - Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure out what it is doing

### Write a short note on formal and natural languages.

| **Natural Language** | **Formal Language** |
| :--: | :--: |
| Natural languages are the languages that people speak, such as English, Spanish, Korean, and Mandarin Chinese. They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally. | Formal languages are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. |
| Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information | Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context. |
| In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose (lengthy/wordy). | Formal languages are less redundant and more concise | 
| Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If I say, “The penny dropped,” there is probably no penny and nothing dropping (this idiom means that someone realized something after a period of confusion). | Formal languages mean exactly what they say. |
